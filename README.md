# Lecture3Vno2018S
Changes after lecture:
-input field clears itself after creating new task
-new element CompletedItem created to replace marked item (completed item doesn't have Delete button)
-checkboxes next to ToDoItems:
    *marking checkbox moves item to the bottom of the list and removes delete button
    *unmarking checkbox moves item just above completed tasks and gives entry an delete button

P.S. nothing was done style wise :/
